# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-for-Predicting-Car-Prices
## AIM:
To write a program to predict car prices using a linear regression model and test the assumptions for linear regression.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Start the program
   
2.Load and preprocess the dataset

3.Build the linear regression model

4.Test linear regression assumptions

5.Predict and evaluate results

## Program:
```
/*
 Program to implement linear regression model for predicting car prices and test assumptions.
Developed by: 
RegisterNumber:  212225240026

## REsult:
Thus, the program to implement a linear regression model for predicting car prices is written and verified using Python programming, along with the testing of key assumptions for linear regression.
